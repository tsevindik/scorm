**The SCORM (Shareable Content Object Reference Model)** is the most used international standard in the world for the creation of courses for distance education. SCORM courses allow a dynamic and interactive training approach, giving the possibility to create both static courses and dynamic activities that involve the learner through videos, interactive slides, dragging of objects, animations and audio.

The eLearning platform supports most of the SCORM versions and are designed to meet customersâ€™ needs. Public and private bodies (training institutions, public administration, universities, schools, companies, etc.) can now implement their own technological structure thanks to the support of tools such as facial recognition, integration with WordPress, validation from Agenas (the Italian National Agency for Regional Health Services) for **CME (Continuous Medical Education)** online courses and integrated e-commerce.
